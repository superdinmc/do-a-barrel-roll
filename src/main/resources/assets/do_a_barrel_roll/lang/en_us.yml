  title: §lDo a Barrel Roll
  general:
    .: General
    mod_enabled: Mod Enabled
    mod_enabled.description: > 
      Enables or disables the mod entirely. 
      Can also be toggled using %1$s ingame.
  controls:
    .: Controls
    switch_roll_and_yaw: Switch Roll and Yaw
    switch_roll_and_yaw.description: >
      Switch the roll and yaw axis while using a mouse to be more in line with vanilla movement. 
      This is not recommended for the best experience™, but might make flying easier for some people.
    momentum_based_mouse: Use Momentum Based Mouse
    momentum_based_mouse.description: > 
      Makes it easier to make continuous movements with the mouse, 
      Though it can take some getting used to.
    show_momentum_widget: Show Momentum Mouse Widget
    show_momentum_widget.description: > 
      Turn the crosshair into a helpful widget when using the momentum based mouse.
      The length of the line indicates the amount of turning power applied in a given direction.
    momentum_mouse_deadzone: Momentum Mouse Deadzone
    momentum_mouse_deadzone.description: >
      Specify a deadzone when using the momentum based mouse. 
      This can make it easier to fly straight, but higher values will make subtle adjustments more difficult.
    activation_behaviour:
      .: Activation Behaviour
      vanilla: Vanilla
      triple_jump: Triple Jump
      hybrid: Hybrid
      hybrid_toggle: Hybrid Toggle
      description:
        .: |+

        vanilla: >
          §lVanilla§r: Same as vanilla; jump once while off the ground.
        triple_jump: >
          §lTriple Jump§r: Requires you to jump twice while off the ground instead of once. 
          Can be helpful in preventing your elytra from activating while sprint jumping.
        hybrid: >
          §lHybrid§r: Jumping once while off the ground activates standard vanilla flight, 
          jumping again after that enables the mod and unlocks the roll axis. Takes some getting used to, 
          but can be helpful when taking off in confined spaces.
        hybrid_toggle: >
          §lHybrid Toggle§r: Same as Hybrid mode, but jumping toggles the mod and roll axis instead of just 
          enabling it once, essentially letting you switch the mod on and off on the fly. (pun intended)
    invert_pitch: Invert Pitch
    invert_pitch.description: >
      Inverts the pitch axis while flying with a mouse.
    disable_when_submerged: Disable When Submerged
    disable_when_submerged.description: >
      Disables the mod while you are underwater. 
      It is recommended to keep this enabled to prevent loss of control while swimming.

    show_horizon.description: Show a simple artificial horizon widget around your crosshair.
  banking:
    .: Flight Options

      Creates a more realistic, plane-like feeling while flying, 
      allowing you to make turns without having to do full 90 degree rolls.
    banking_strength: Banking Strength
    simulate_control_surface_efficacy: Simulate Control Surface Efficacy
    simulate_control_surface_efficacy.description: >
      Makes... an attempt to simulate the variable authority of different control surfaces based on your current angle of attack.
      This is experimental and subject to change in the future, but might improve your flight experience.
  thrust:
    .: Thrusting Options
    enable_thrust: Enable Thrusting
    enable_thrust.description: >
      Enables you to use the forward and back keys (W and S by default) 
      to infinitely accelerate and decelerate respectively.
      
      §4This feature is disabled on any server that does not explicitly allow it.
    max_thrust: Max Thrusting Speed
    max_thrust.description: >
      The maximum speed that can be reached by thrusting. 
      Setting this to anything above 2-3 might cause
      problems with chunks not loading fast enough.
    thrust_acceleration: Thrusting Acceleration
    thrust_acceleration.description: >
      The acceleration of thrusting. 
      Higher values will make it easier to reach max speed.

    force_enabled: Force Mod Enabled
    force_enabled.description: >
      Forces the mod to be enabled for all players on the server. 
      This will disable client-side toggling and some activation behaviours.
    force_installed: Force Mod Installed
    force_installed.description: >
      Forces the mod to be installed for all players on the server. 
      This will kick any players that don't have the mod loaded.
    installed_timeout: Installed Check Timeout
    installed_timeout.description: >
      The amount of time in seconds that the server will 
      wait for a client to respond to the handshake before kicking them.
      §lIncrease this if players with bad connections are getting kicked even though they have the mod installed.

    banking_x_formula: Banking X Function
    banking_x_formula.description: |
      §7This expression is used to calculate the amount of absolute yaw to apply when banking is enabled.
      By default, this is based on the player's current pitch and roll, and the configured banking strength.
      
      Note: Absolute yaw in this case means the yaw that is applied as if the player's roll were zero.
      
      Additional variables:
        - §f$§abanking_strength§7: The configured banking strength.
    banking_y_formula: Banking Y Function

      §7This expression is used to calculate the amount of absolute pitch to apply when banking is enabled.
      By default, this is based on the player's current pitch and roll, and the configured banking strength.

  control_surface_efficacy:
    .: Control Surface Efficacy Calculations
    elevator: Elevator (Pitch)
    elevator.description: >
      §7This expression is used to calculate the efficacy of the elevator control surface.
      By default, this is based on the estimated angle of attack of the control surface.
    aileron: Aileron (Roll)
    aileron.description: >
      §7This expression is used to calculate the efficacy of the aileron control surface.
      By default, this is based on the estimated angle of attack of the control surface.
    rudder: Rudder (Yaw)

      §7The expressions above use a custom expression language that allows you to use variables and functions in your calculations.
      
      
      For basic mathematical operations, you can use the standard operators: §d+§7, §d-§7, §d*§7, §d/§7, and §d^§7 for exponentiation.
      The calculation order follows PEMDAS, so you can use parentheses to group operations.
      
      
      Aside from that, there are three types of named expression you can use:
        - §f$§avariables§7: These start with a §f$§7, and hold dynamic values.
        - §efunctions§f()§7: These are names followed by parentheses, and take arguments in the parentheses.
        - §6CONSTANTS§7: These are names that are not variables or functions, and are replaced with a constant value.
      
      
      Expand the categories below to see the available variables, functions, and constants.
